# -S3-Form-Detection-on-PPM-Images

A second University year project made with C and OpenGL utility toolkit about detection of forms on ppm P6 images format.

This project aims to isolate forms on an image step by step. We could select the step we want.

There is steps we could select in the application:
  * Original Image
  * High Contrast Pixels
  * High Contrast Connex Pixels
  * Aligned Pixels
  * Forms

- An image with the ```.ppm (p6)``` extension if you won't use mine

### How to use - *Linux Project*
